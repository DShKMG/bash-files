Opening the file descriptors for reading and writing

Be carefull and do not use 0, 1, 2 for fd commands

exec fd<>fileName

File descriptor 0 is used if fd is not specified.
If the file does not exist, it is created.
This syntax is useful to update file.


Create a shell script called fdreadwrite.sh

#!/bin/bash
FILENAME="/tmp/out.txt"
# Opening file descriptors # 3 for reading and writing
# i.e. /tmp/out.txt
exec 3<>$FILENAME

# Write to file
echo "Today is $(date)" >&3
echo "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. " >&3
echo "Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." >&3
echo "--- Yoda" >&3

# close fd # 3
exec 3>&-


Read from files

read -u fd var1 var2 ... varN 

It is better to do it in while loop

while IFS= read -u fd -r line	#fd can be 3 4 5 etc depends on the file description.
do
                 command1 on $line
                 command2 on $line
                 ..
                 ....
                 commandN
done
